# Problem 1: Multiples of 3 and 5
# Find the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below a given limit.

# Define a function called multiples_3_5 that takes a single argument, `limit`.
multiples_3_5 <- function(limit) {
  # Generate a sequence of multiples of 3 below the given limit.
  # seq(0, limit-1, by=3) creates a sequence starting at 0, ending just below the limit, incrementing by 3.
  multiples_3 <- seq(0, limit-1, by=3)
  
  # Generate a sequence of multiples of 5 below the given limit.
  # seq(0, limit-1, by=5) creates a sequence starting at 0, ending just below the limit, incrementing by 5.
  multiples_5 <- seq(0, limit-1, by=5)
  
  # Combine the two sequences of multiples into a single vector.
  # Use `unique()` to remove any duplicate values (numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, e.g., 15, 30, etc.).
  all_multiples <- unique(c(multiples_3, multiples_5))
  
  # Calculate the sum of all unique multiples of 3 or 5.
  sum_multiples <- sum(all_multiples)
  
  # Return the sum as the result of the function.
  return(sum_multiples)
}

# Call the function with a limit of 1000 to solve the problem.
# The problem asks for the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
result = multiples_3_5(1000)

# Print the result to the console.
print(result)

# The expected output (answer) is 233168.
